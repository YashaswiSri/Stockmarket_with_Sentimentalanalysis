#Stockify
Stockify is a project designed to predict stock prices and analyze the impact of news on 
those prices. The project utilizes the yfinance library to download historical stock data and 
employs an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model to forecast future stock prices. In 
addition to price prediction, Stockify uses an API to fetch the latest news articles that may 
influence the company's stock price. By combining the predicted stock prices and the sentiment 
index, Stockify provides users with a comprehensive overview of the stock's potential future 
performance. This information is then used to generate a message that helps users make 
informed decisions about their investments. The project aims to simplify stock market analysis 
by integrating advanced machine learning techniques with real-time news sentiment analysis
